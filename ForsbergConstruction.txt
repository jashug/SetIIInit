Assume we have defined indexed inductive specifications in a way that matches II types, so allowing
mixing sorts and operations, so that everything is a simple fold.

semantic contexts consist of:
an inductive specification of the pre-syntax
for each pre-algebra,
  an inductive specification of the goodness predicates
  for each goodness algebra (non-inductive-inductive)
    a set of sorts
    for each sort
      a sort in the pre-syntax specification
      for each value in the corresponding pre-sort
        a sort in the goodness specification

semantic sort types, operation types, and data should follow similarly
